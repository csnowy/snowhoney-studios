    <h3>1. General Policy</h3>
    <p>We want you to be happy with your purchase. If we fail to deliver your service as promised, you may be eligible for a full or partial refund under the terms below.</p>

    <h3>2. Packages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Mockup Only:</b> Fully refundable before delivery. Once the mockup is delivered, the order is final.</li>
      <li><b>One-Page / Two-Page / Three-Page Builds:</b> Fully refundable if work has not yet begun. Once we start design or development, refunds may be prorated at our discretion.</li>
      <li><b>Turnaround Guarantee:</b> If we fail to deliver your finished site within 7 days of order (unless delayed by missing client information), you are entitled to a full refund.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Hosting</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Hosting Only Orders:</b> May be cancelled within 7 days of purchase for a full refund, provided setup has not begun. After setup begins, hosting is non-refundable but you may cancel future billing anytime via the client portal.</li>
      <li><b>Hosting with Site Builds:</b> Hosting charges begin 7 days after checkout or once your free trial ends (depending on your package). Hosting is billed monthly and is non-refundable once a billing cycle has started, but you can cancel future renewals anytime.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Add-Ons</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Extra Pages:</b> Refundable only if no work has begun. Once design or coding has started, extra pages are non-refundable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Coupons & Discounts</h3>
    <p>If you applied a coupon, promotional discount, or mockup credit, refunds will not exceed the amount you actually paid. The value of discounts themselves is non-refundable.</p>

    <h3>6. Client Portal</h3>
    <p>You can manage hosting cancellations, upgrades, and edits at any time through the Snowhoney Studios client portal. Portal access is provided to the email used at checkout.</p>
