    <h3>1. Website Builds</h3>
    <p>Refund available only if canceled before work begins. Once started, payments are non-refundable. If we fail our 7-day launch guarantee (and you provided content on time), you may request a full refund.</p>
    <p>
      Requests that fall outside the scope of the original package (such as additional pages or complex integrations) 
      are not included in the original fee and will be billed separately. Payments for add-on work are non-refundable once started.

    <p>The $99 mockup is non-refundable once delivered.</p>

    <h3>3. Hosting Plans</h3>
