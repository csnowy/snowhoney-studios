    <h2 class="section-title">Terms of Service</h2>
    <p><em>Last updated: [Sept 17th, 2025]</em></p>

    <h3>1. Scope of Services</h3>
    <p>Website builds, revisions, hosting plans, and mockups are provided as described on our website. Each page includes up to 2 revisions. Additional work may incur extra charges.</p>
    <p>
      For the purposes of package limits, a "page" is defined as a unique section of the site with its own layout and navigation link.  
      Long scrolling sections are treated as one page, and repeatable content (such as products or blog posts) is included as part of an e-commerce or blog setup, not counted individually.  
      Pop-ups and simple modals are considered features of an existing page.  
      Snowhoney Studios reserves the right to determine page counts in good faith to maintain site performance and consistency.
    </p>

    <h3>1b. Third-Party Integrations</h3>
      <p>
        We may embed third-party tools (such as booking systems, scheduling widgets, or email marketing popups) 
        at the client’s request. Simple embed codes are included in the package. 
        Complex or custom integrations may require additional fees or extended timelines, which will always be communicated in advance.
      </p>

    <h3>2. Client Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>Clients must provide necessary materials (logos, content, product info) promptly. The 7-day launch guarantee depends on receiving required content within 48 hours of our request. For e-commerce, clients must create a Stripe account and grant us admin access.</p>
    <p>
      Clients are solely responsible for ensuring that all materials they provide (logos, images, text, products, etc.) 
      are properly licensed and do not infringe copyright, trademarks, or applicable laws. 
      Snowhoney Studios is not responsible for any disputes arising from client-provided content.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Payment Terms</h3>
    <p>All packages must be paid in full via Stripe Checkout. Hosting renews monthly via Stripe subscription. Payments are non-refundable once work begins, except as noted in our Refund Policy.</p>

    <h3>4. Ownership & Rights</h3>
    <p>Clients own their website content and domains once paid in full. Snowhoney Studios retains ownership of templates and tools but licenses their use with the site. Domains managed by us can be transferred upon request.</p>

    <h3>5. Maintenance & Support</h3>
    <p>Hosting plans include services as described (Basic, Boost, Dominate). Requests beyond the plan may require upgrades or extra charges.</p>

    <h3>6. Refunds & Cancellations</h3>
    <p>Refunds are only available as described in our Refund Policy.</p>

    <h3>7. Liability</h3>
    <p>Snowhoney Studios is not liable for business losses due to downtime, errors, or third-party outages (Netlify, Stripe, Zoho, etc.). Our maximum liability is limited to the amount paid for the service in question.</p>

    <h3>8. Privacy</h3>
    <p>See our Privacy Policy for details on how we handle data.</p>

    <h3>9. Termination</h3>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate services if payments fail, illegal activity occurs, or these terms are violated.</p>

    <h3>10. Changes</h3>
    <p>We may update these Terms at any time. Updates will be posted here.</p>
