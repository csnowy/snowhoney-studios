    <p><em>Last updated: October 1, 2025</em></p>

    <h3>1. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
    <p>By purchasing services from Snowhoney Studios, you agree to these Terms of Service and our Refund and Privacy Policies.</p>

    <h3>2. Services</h3>
    <p>We provide one-time website build packages (One-Page, Two-Page, Three-Page), mockup-only previews, add-on pages, and monthly hosting subscriptions (Basic, Boost, Dominate). Clients may also subscribe to hosting without a site build (“Hosting Only”).</p>

    <h3>3. Add-Ons</h3>
    <p>Extra pages may be purchased at checkout. Add-ons extend your chosen package but do not automatically include new features beyond the base package.</p>

    <h3>4. Coupons & Discounts</h3>
    <p>We may provide promotional codes, discounts, or credits (including mockup credits). Such offers are limited-time, non-transferable, and non-refundable. Refunds for discounted purchases will not exceed the amount actually paid.</p>

    <h3>5. Hosting Terms</h3>
    <p>Hosting is billed monthly. Hosting begins 7 days after checkout or once your free trial ends (if applicable). Hosting fees are non-refundable once a billing cycle begins, but you may cancel future billing anytime via the client portal. We are not responsible for downtime caused by third-party providers (domain registrars, DNS, etc.).</p>

    <h3>6. Client Portal</h3>
    <p>Active customers receive access to a client portal for managing subscriptions, requesting edits, and updating billing. One-time codes are sent by email for secure login. You are responsible for maintaining access to the email used at checkout.</p>

    <h3>7. Payment & Billing</h3>
    <p>All payments are processed through Stripe. Hosting subscriptions renew automatically until cancelled. Failed payments may result in suspension of services until payment is received.</p>

    <h3>8. Ownership</h3>
    <p>Website code and content remain your property. If you choose self-hosting, we will provide your files upon launch. If you are on our hosting, you may request transfer of your domain and site files at any time.</p>

    <h3>9. Refunds</h3>
    <p>Refunds are governed by our <a href="refunds.html">Refund Policy</a>, which is incorporated by reference.</p>

    <h3>10. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>Snowhoney Studios is not liable for indirect damages, lost profits, or business interruption resulting from use of our services. Total liability is limited to the amount you paid us in the past 12 months.</p>

    <h3>11. Changes</h3>
    <p>We may update these Terms of Service at any time. Updates will be posted here with a new “last updated” date.</p>
