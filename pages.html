    <p><em>Last updated: [Sept 22nd, 2025]</em></p>

    <h3>Definition</h3>
    <p>
      A <b>page</b> is any unique section of your site with its own layout and menu link (e.g., Home, About, Services, Contact).  
      Each page is designed and built individually to match your brand and goals.
    </p>

    <h3>Scrolling Sections</h3>
    <p>
      Long scrolling sections (like this homepage) count as <b>one page</b> — even if it has many sub-sections (intro, services, testimonials, contact form, etc.).
    </p>

    <h3>Repeatable Content</h3>
    <p>
      Collections of content that follow the same template do <b>not</b> count as separate pages.  
      Examples: individual blog posts, store products, or team member bios.  
      These are included as part of your <b>blog</b> or <b>e-commerce setup</b>.
    </p>

    <h3>Pop-Ups & Modals</h3>
    <p>
      Pop-ups and modals (like newsletter sign-ups, contact forms, login windows, or info boxes) 
      are treated as <b>features of an existing page</b>, not separate pages.  
      They are included in your package if they relate directly to the site’s content.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, if a modal functions like a full extra page (for example: a detailed multi-step form, 
      embedded scheduling tool, or separate “mini-site” experience), it may count as an <b>additional page</b> 
      or require a small add-on fee. We’ll always make this clear up front.
    </p>

    <h3>Length & Performance</h3>
    <p>
      If a single page exceeds roughly <b>5 full scrolls</b> of content on desktop, we may recommend splitting it into 2 pages.  
      This keeps your site loading fast and content easier for visitors to digest.
    </p>

    <h3>What’s Included in Packages</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>1-Page Site:</b> A scrolling homepage with all your content in one place, just like Snowhoney.</li>
      <li><b>2-Page Site:</b> Homepage + one additional page (often Services, Shop, or About).</li>
      <li><b>3-Page Site:</b> Homepage + two additional pages (e.g., Shop, Blog, Careers).</li>
      <li><b>More Pages:</b> You can add extra pages to any package for a flat fee (see checkout for details).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Counts as 1 Page:</b> Homepage with sections for introduction, services, testimonials, contact form.</li>
      <li><b>Counts as 2 Pages:</b> Homepage + a dedicated Services page.</li>
      <li><b>Counts as 3 Pages:</b> Homepage + Shop page (with 20 products) + Careers page.</li>
      <li><b>Extra Page Add-on:</b> Adding a Blog, Gallery, FAQ, Team, or Careers page.</li>
      <li><b>Pop-up Example:</b> Newsletter signup modal on the homepage = included as part of that page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Not Counted as Pages</h3>
    <p>
      - Each store product or category (these are counted as the same page)<br>
      - Every blog post (also counted as the same page)<br>
      - Legal pages like Privacy Policy, Terms, and Refunds<br>
      - Simple pop-ups for signups, forms, or info<br>
    </p>

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Our goal is to keep things simple: if it’s a unique section that needs its own proper design and menu link, it counts as a page.  
      Medium length scrolling pages like ours, repeatable items, and simple pop-ups don’t increase your page count.  
      This way, you know exactly what you’re getting, with no hidden costs or surprises.
